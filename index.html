        Hi hi! I’m Anna Burns, a 17 year old girl from Texas. I’m a senior at a public high school in 
        Houston. I’ve picked up some coding skills from taking classes/ self teaching, and I just think it’s pretty fun! 
        In my spare time I like to read, write, draw, and watch numerous youtube videos on random things I might or might not ever use. 
        One of my biggest goals/dreams in life is creating something that would positively impact people, 
        like contributing to a medical invention. This website will serve as my portfolio for things I’ve made/ am making in all realms 
        and want to share to the world! 

      </p>

        Since you’ve stumbled here dear traveller, stay a while. It’s warm here, protected from the harsh winds of cyberattacks out there. Have a cup of tea and explore!
